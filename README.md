Hi! I am currently a 1st year student pursuing BSIT at University of Doha for Science and Technology. I became interested and passionate about the field when I chose computer programming as my TLE subject during my high school. This experience opened the door for me become interested in computer processes, programming, and structures. 

On the other side of things, I am also interested in web design and implementation.I believe in the notion of breaking down complex problems into smaller more manageable pieces and taking concepts one step at a time.

Besides IT, I also have a background and experience in photography as well as designing inforgraphics and posters.4
